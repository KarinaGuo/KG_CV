    "text": "I’m firstly a curious (and admittedly chaotic) soul. But after that, I’m a plant ecologist who love all taxa, okay, except maybe the palms. I’ve dabbled in trait ecology, machine learning, and now genetics. All in a search to find what my niche is. Come check out what I’ve been up to in my posts, ranging from social outreach to new bits of code. Want to work with me? Feel free to send me an email or reach out in my socials!"

Includes ability to safely work with liquid nitrogen, CTAB buffers, rare earth metal clean up, DNA purification and quantification through NanoDrop One & Agilent Tape.\nRefactoring of the genetics processing of DArT SNP data for the Restore and Renew (RnR) webtool. Involved version control using Git, containerising the RnR genetics workflow on Docker, multi-stage builds of workflow, supporting project development, and outreach. Showed proficiency in collaborating with other team members to enhance existing workflows and develop new features for future pathways of the tool.\nManaging ~70,000 samples through databasing collection information, maintenance and organisation of their storage. Processing of incoming material in preparation of new samples and vouchers.\nApplied engagement in concepts of genetics including conducting GWAS on individuals of Melaleuca quinquenervia to discover markers that signify rust resistance\nEngaging in field work trips to help gather genetic samples. Involves learning flora identification skills, scheduling appropriate accommodation, and following WHS protocols.\nRapid selection and preparation of samples to send to Diversity Arrays Technology for genetic sampling\nOutreach at conferences for external points of collaboration across states of Australia and feedback on procedures and workflows"
