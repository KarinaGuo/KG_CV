    "section": "",
    "text": "This is Part 1 of 2, where I briefly go through how I made my machine learning models, and what they do\n\nTo look at the source code, feel free to check out my GitHub\n\n\n\nMy project involved three key parts:\n\nPrepare my data for training, validating, and testing my machine learning models\nMy two machine learning models were then created with the datasets\nI used my machine learning models to make my dataset which was analysed for trends\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Workflow of project\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nTo build a good machine learning model, I needed a well-annotated training dataset to train, optimise and evaluate my model. In my case, this was done through manual annotation of herbarium sheets (archived pressed plant images). Manual annotation is essentially me telling the machine learning model what to ‘learn’, and looked like spending hours tracing the outlines of leaves on these sheets.\nThe annotated datasets were then divided into three sets: the training set, the validating set, and the testing set.\n\nTraining Set: Used to train the model by showing it what pixels represented a leaf on a herbarium sheet.\nValidating Set: Employed to optimise the model’s hyperparameters and ensure proper it generalises well on unseen data.\nTesting Set: Used to evaluate the model’s performance and accuracy\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThis first model I created was aimed to segment leaves from herbarium sheets; to create masks of the pixels that represent each individual leaf, as in This process involved a cycle of optimisation. First, feed in the training and validating dataset with initial training parameters. These parameters shaped how the model learnt. Then, evaluate the quality of the first iteration of the model.\nThis step involved both qualitative and quantitative metrics. Qualitative metrics were looking at all the predicted herbarium sheets, like in Figure 2, and judging how it went. Did it do poorly on small leaves? Worse on broken leaves? And, so forth. Using these metrics I judged what needed to be amended in the training dataset for the next iteration. Similarly, quantitative metrics involved calculating values such as Precision, Recall, and F1-score which are measures of true positives, false negatives, etc. that are standardised in the machine learning field. From these metrics, I then changed the training dataset the model needed to improve it for the next iteration.\nOnce I’ve done more painstaking labelling of the training dataset, and tweaked the training parameters, I embarked the model on the second iteration. Training a brand new model and conducting the evaluation metrics again. I kept repeating this cycle until I was satisfied with the quality of the model.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Predicted herbarium sheet, each colour is a separate leaf mask\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nTo enhance the quality and accuracy of my workflow, I then developed a leaf classifier model. This model acted as an additional layer of filtration, classifying the output of the segmentation model into valid and invalid leaves.\nUsing the segmented leaf images generated by the first model, I manually annotated the images to create the necessary datasets for training, validating, and testing the leaf classifier model. Here, manual annotation involved me categorising leaf images generated by the first model as valid and invalid leaves. Then, like before, separating those images into the three datasets.\nOnce again, the creation of this model involved optimisation. Iterations of this machine learning model was crucial in ensuring the model was of apt quality and could accurately identify valid leaves.\n\nFigure 3. Example of valid and invalid leaf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValid leaf\n\nInvalid leaf\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAfter being satisfied with both models, I applied them to the remaining herbarium images. This process generated a massive dataset, comprising of approximately 130,000 data points. The size of this dataset was 50 times larger than the previous datasets. This gave me an amazing framework where I could ask so many more questions during the analysis. It greatly expanded the sampling done at both a taxonomic level (inter- and intra- specific sampling), and at a spatial scale across Australia, to a degree not done before.\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe final step in my project involved analysing the massive dataset created by the machine learning models. This dataset contained detailed information about the leaves, including their leaf area, leaf curvature and the size of the largest in-circle. As each herbarium sheet had their collection latitude and longitude I could then map it to climate, and see how the leaf traits changed across various variables. Furthermore, with their indepth taxonomic sampling, for the first time in literature, I explored how the leaf trait varied across the eucalypt taxonomy.\nFor a detailed analysis of the trends and patterns discovered in the dataset, check out my next blog post, where I share my novel findings and pretty graphs."

    "text": "This is Part 2 of 2, here I analyse my dataset from the last part to explore two key questions\n\nTo look at the source code, feel free to check out my GitHub\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nProject explored how leaf traits shift across the Australian climate and how phylogeny shaped leaf traits\nFound that leaf area was positively associated with mean annual precipitation\nSaw a strong variation in the trait-climate relationship was seen within species\nFrom the shallowest depths of this phylogeny to the deepest, i.e. from species to genera, there was an overall increase in the mean slope of the association between leaf area and precipitation\nSaw was at ~8.5 MYA there was a rapid convergence to the overall slope hypothesised to be due to gene flow ceasing\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nIn this part of my project I wanted to see how the leaf trait changed across 1. Climate and 2. Phylogeny. Like mentioned in my last post, I could investigate how the trait changed in congruence with each other because of the site of the dataset.\n\nIn summary, the questions and hypothesise I proposed prior to the project were:\n\nHow do leaf traits shift across the Australian climate?\nI hypothesise that leaf area and largest in-circle area will correlate positively with mean annual precipitation and temperature\nTo what extent does phylogeny shape leaf traits?\nI hypothesise that gene flow will resolve in large trait variability at a shallow phylogenetic level (within species), which will gradually resolve to a trait-climate relationship at deeper levels (for example, among species).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nTo really understand why I was asking these questions, a bit of context is needed.\nFirstly, leaf area. As many of you readers are probably well aware of, leaves are the fundamental units of photosynthesis. And because of this, they have a vast range of impacts at different levels of scales. From affecting the carbon cycle around the globe, to influencing species interaction at an individual level. Therefore, as a better understanding of leaf trait variation can result in better predictions and models.\nWe know that, leaf traits, such as leaf area, are tied to their environment. This may come in the form of a constraint, where a climatic variable may result in the trait being no bigger or smaller than a certain size (e.g., see Wright et al. 2017, Guo et al. 2000, Cornelissen 1999). For instance, leaf area has been found to increase from dry to wet environments and from colder to hotter climates. And this may have been due to leaf area being linked to thermal regulation. Where a more effective thermal regulation and reduced water loss is found in leaves that are smaller, particularly those that are more narrow. However, this trend isn’t always this simple and can vary at a geographic and taxonomic scale. As such, my study, for the first time, looks at this trend within every species of eucalypts (Angohphora, Corymbia, Eucalyptus) in detail for all of Australia. In particular I looked at eucalypt leaf traits of Australia, and how they varied against mean annual precipitation and climate\nBut what I found more interesting in this study was looking at this how evolutionary history played an influence on the relationship between trait and climate. As such, I aimed to investigate how this trait-climate trend changed within and across different phylogenetic classifications, such as species, subgenera and genera. Existing literature acknowledges that phylogeny and contemporary demography, including intraspecific gene flow, may result in this trait-climate trend within species being weaker, unrelated, or even following opposite directions to that reported among species. For example, gene flow between two populations may hinder the adaptation of leaf traits to their local environment, causing the trait-climate trend to diverge from the expected trend. On top of this, an individual’s evolutionary history may constrain phenotype and local adaptive capacity. However, current literature is unable to fully understanding these factors, possibly due to the limitations of current datasets generated using traditional methods.\nMy study places itself in a unique position with its use of the machine learning models detailed previously. With its application, I was able to create a comprehensive dataset that spans various taxonomic levels across Australia. By pairing this dataset with a fully resolved phylogenetic tree (Thornhill et al. 2019), I could link microevolution to macroevolution, and ask the questions I posed prior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: As a preface, the following sections will focus on how leaf area varied against mean annual precipitation as that were the most interesting findings of all traits and climatic variables.\n\n \n\n\n\n\nWe found that leaf area was positively associated with mean annual precipitation. This aligned to what was found in other studies of eucalypts. However, when compared to a study that looked at all taxa globally, we saw that eucalypts had a weaker and shallower slope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen then looked at how evolutionary history impacted the trait-climate relationship, i.e. the slope of our models. We saw that when we took a mean value within species, this resulted in the slope being greater and better reflected those of other studies (Falster et al. 2021, Wright et al. 2017). However, when species was added as a random effect we saw the opposite, a smaller slope. In essence, this meant that a strong variation in the trait-climate relationship was seen within species. A similar analysis was then done at different phylogenetic classifications including subgenera and genera. When looking at subgenera, we got the mean trait value within each slope and used that to see how the leaf trait changed against precipitation. And, as a result, we saw a dramatically greater slope (closer to that of other analyses), than in comparison to the species level. Likewise at the genera level, we also saw a greater slope, though less significantly than subgenera. In summary, from the shallowest depths of this phylogeny to the deepest, i.e. from species to genera, there was an overall increase in the mean slope of the association between leaf area and precipitation.\nFurthermore, our machine learning method also allowed us to look at this model throughout the whole span of time of the phylogeny. We know that the average trait-climate slope of species is roughly at 0.2, and that the overall slope of eucalypts is 0.4 (i.e. no grouping). However, current literature is unable to answer what happens at these two points? Well this is where my massive dataset comes in. Using Thornhill’s resolved phylogenetic tree, we separated the entire age of the tree into 20 separate intervals. At each time interval, tips that had split prior to the point were kept as individual unique lineages, while those that had split after the time interval was merged by common ancestry into a single ‘lineage’. For instance, the 1st interval was at 0 million years ago and included every tip of the tree as a lineage (418 lineages). Whereas, at the 3rd interval, 8.57 million years ago, 77 lineages were present. Running the statistical model at each lineage, and generating the overall slope. We then generate the following graph. And what we saw was at ~8.5 MYA there was a rapid convergence to the overall slope (akin to the species to subgenera separation mentioned prior). In which, I hypothesised to be due to gene flow. Where, at this point, gene flow ceases and we see that rapid convergence of the slope to the genus level.\n\n\n\nThe phylogenetic tree was split at 20 intervals at evenly spaced time periods. The mean slope within the lineages at each time point was calculated. For example, 0 MY had each species as a random effect, whereas 55 MY had two groups of species, corresponding to the deepest branch among the eucalypts. A convergence towards an approximate average slope was observed roughly 8.5 MY."

    "text": "This is Part 2 of 2, here I analyse my dataset from the last part to explore two key questions\n\nTo look at the source code, feel free to check out my GitHub\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nProject explored how leaf traits shift across the Australian climate and how phylogeny shaped leaf traits\nFound that leaf area was positively associated with mean annual precipitation\nSaw a strong variation in the trait-climate relationship was seen within species\nFrom the shallowest depths of this phylogeny to the deepest, i.e. from species to genera, there was an overall increase in the mean slope of the association between leaf area and precipitation\nSaw was at ~8.5 MYA there was a rapid convergence to the overall slope hypothesised to be due to gene flow ceasing\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nIn this part of my project I wanted to see how the leaf trait changed across 1. Climate and 2. Phylogeny. Like mentioned in my last post, I could investigate how the trait changed in congruence with each other because of the site of the dataset.\n\nIn summary, the questions and hypothesise I proposed prior to the project were:\n\nHow do leaf traits shift across the Australian climate?\nI hypothesise that leaf area and largest in-circle area will correlate positively with mean annual precipitation and temperature\nTo what extent does phylogeny shape leaf traits?\nI hypothesise that gene flow will resolve in large trait variability at a shallow phylogenetic level (within species), which will gradually resolve to a trait-climate relationship at deeper levels (for example, among species).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nTo really understand why I was asking these questions, a bit of context is needed.\nFirstly, leaf area. As many of you readers are probably well aware of, leaves are the fundamental units of photosynthesis. And because of this, they have a vast range of impacts at different levels of scales. From affecting the carbon cycle around the globe, to influencing species interaction at an individual level. Therefore, as a better understanding of leaf trait variation can result in better predictions and models.\nWe know that, leaf traits, such as leaf area, are tied to their environment. This may come in the form of a constraint, where a climatic variable may result in the trait being no bigger or smaller than a certain size (e.g., see Wright et al. 2017, Guo et al. 2000, Cornelissen 1999). For instance, leaf area has been found to increase from dry to wet environments and from colder to hotter climates. And this may have been due to leaf area being linked to thermal regulation. Where a more effective thermal regulation and reduced water loss is found in leaves that are smaller, particularly those that are more narrow. However, this trend isn’t always this simple and can vary at a geographic and taxonomic scale. As such, my study, for the first time, looks at this trend within every species of eucalypts (Angohphora, Corymbia, Eucalyptus) in detail for all of Australia. In particular I looked at eucalypt leaf traits of Australia, and how they varied against mean annual precipitation and climate\nBut what I found more interesting in this study was looking at this how evolutionary history played an influence on the relationship between trait and climate. As such, I aimed to investigate how this trait-climate trend changed within and across different phylogenetic classifications, such as species, subgenera and genera. Existing literature acknowledges that phylogeny and contemporary demography, including intraspecific gene flow, may result in this trait-climate trend within species being weaker, unrelated, or even following opposite directions to that reported among species. For example, gene flow between two populations may hinder the adaptation of leaf traits to their local environment, causing the trait-climate trend to diverge from the expected trend. On top of this, an individual’s evolutionary history may constrain phenotype and local adaptive capacity. However, current literature is unable to fully understanding these factors, possibly due to the limitations of current datasets generated using traditional methods.\nMy study places itself in a unique position with its use of the machine learning models detailed previously. With its application, I was able to create a comprehensive dataset that spans various taxonomic levels across Australia. By pairing this dataset with a fully resolved phylogenetic tree (Thornhill et al. 2019), I could link microevolution to macroevolution, and ask the questions I posed prior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: As a preface, the following sections will focus on how leaf area varied against mean annual precipitation as that were the most interesting findings of all traits and climatic variables.\n\n \n\n\n\n\nWe found that leaf area was positively associated with mean annual precipitation. This aligned to what was found in other studies of eucalypts. However, when compared to a study that looked at all taxa globally, we saw that eucalypts had a weaker and shallower slope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen then looked at how evolutionary history impacted the trait-climate relationship, i.e. the slope of our models. We saw that when we took a mean value within species, this resulted in the slope being greater and better reflected those of other studies (Falster et al. 2021, Wright et al. 2017). However, when species was added as a random effect we saw the opposite, a smaller slope. In essence, this meant that a strong variation in the trait-climate relationship was seen within species. A similar analysis was then done at different phylogenetic classifications including subgenera and genera. When looking at subgenera, we got the mean trait value within each slope and used that to see how the leaf trait changed against precipitation. And, as a result, we saw a dramatically greater slope (closer to that of other analyses), than in comparison to the species level. Likewise at the genera level, we also saw a greater slope, though less significantly than subgenera. In summary, from the shallowest depths of this phylogeny to the deepest, i.e. from species to genera, there was an overall increase in the mean slope of the association between leaf area and precipitation.\nFurthermore, our machine learning method also allowed us to look at this model throughout the whole span of time of the phylogeny. We know that the average trait-climate slope of species is roughly at 0.2, and that the overall slope of eucalypts is 0.4 (i.e. no grouping). However, current literature is unable to answer what happens at these two points? Well this is where my massive dataset comes in. Using Thornhill’s resolved phylogenetic tree, we separated the entire age of the tree into 20 separate intervals. At each time interval, tips that had split prior to the point were kept as individual unique lineages, while those that had split after the time interval was merged by common ancestry into a single ‘lineage’. For instance, the 1st interval was at 0 million years ago and included every tip of the tree as a lineage (418 lineages). Whereas, at the 3rd interval, 8.57 million years ago, 77 lineages were present. Running the statistical model at each lineage, and generating the overall slope. We then generate the following graph. And what we saw was at ~8.5 MYA there was a rapid convergence to the overall slope (akin to the species to subgenera separation mentioned prior). In which, I hypothesised to be due to gene flow. Where, at this point, gene flow ceases and we see that rapid convergence of the slope to the genus level.\n\n\n\nThe phylogenetic tree was split at 20 intervals at evenly spaced time periods. The mean slope within the lineages at each time point was calculated. For example, 0 MY had each species as a random effect, whereas 55 MY had two groups of species, corresponding to the deepest branch among the eucalypts. A convergence towards an approximate average slope was observed roughly 8.5 MY."

    "text": "This is Part 1 of 2, where I briefly go through how I made my machine learning models, and what they do\n\nTo look at the source code, feel free to check out my GitHub\n\n\n\nMy project involved three key parts:\n\nPrepare my data for training, validating, and testing my machine learning models\nMy two machine learning models were then created with the datasets\nI used my machine learning models to make my dataset which was analysed for trends\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Workflow of project\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nTo build a good machine learning model, I needed a well-annotated training dataset to train, optimise and evaluate my model. In my case, this was done through manual annotation of herbarium sheets (archived pressed plant images). Manual annotation is essentially me telling the machine learning model what to ‘learn’, and looked like spending hours tracing the outlines of leaves on these sheets.\nThe annotated datasets were then divided into three sets: the training set, the validating set, and the testing set.\n\nTraining Set: Used to train the model by showing it what pixels represented a leaf on a herbarium sheet.\nValidating Set: Employed to optimise the model’s hyperparameters and ensure proper it generalises well on unseen data.\nTesting Set: Used to evaluate the model’s performance and accuracy\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThis first model I created was aimed to segment leaves from herbarium sheets; to create masks of the pixels that represent each individual leaf, as in This process involved a cycle of optimisation. First, feed in the training and validating dataset with initial training parameters. These parameters shaped how the model learnt. Then, evaluate the quality of the first iteration of the model.\nThis step involved both qualitative and quantitative metrics. Qualitative metrics were looking at all the predicted herbarium sheets, like in Figure 2, and judging how it went. Did it do poorly on small leaves? Worse on broken leaves? And, so forth. Using these metrics I judged what needed to be amended in the training dataset for the next iteration. Similarly, quantitative metrics involved calculating values such as Precision, Recall, and F1-score which are measures of true positives, false negatives, etc. that are standardised in the machine learning field. From these metrics, I then changed the training dataset the model needed to improve it for the next iteration.\nOnce I’ve done more painstaking labelling of the training dataset, and tweaked the training parameters, I embarked the model on the second iteration. Training a brand new model and conducting the evaluation metrics again. I kept repeating this cycle until I was satisfied with the quality of the model.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Predicted herbarium sheet, each colour is a separate leaf mask\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nTo enhance the quality and accuracy of my workflow, I then developed a leaf classifier model. This model acted as an additional layer of filtration, classifying the output of the segmentation model into valid and invalid leaves.\nUsing the segmented leaf images generated by the first model, I manually annotated the images to create the necessary datasets for training, validating, and testing the leaf classifier model. Here, manual annotation involved me categorising leaf images generated by the first model as valid and invalid leaves. Then, like before, separating those images into the three datasets.\nOnce again, the creation of this model involved optimisation. Iterations of this machine learning model was crucial in ensuring the model was of apt quality and could accurately identify valid leaves.\n\nFigure 3. Example of valid and invalid leaf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValid leaf\n\nInvalid leaf\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAfter being satisfied with both models, I applied them to the remaining herbarium images. This process generated a massive dataset, comprising of approximately 130,000 data points. The size of this dataset was 50 times larger than the previous datasets. This gave me an amazing framework where I could ask so many more questions during the analysis. It greatly expanded the sampling done at both a taxonomic level (inter- and intra- specific sampling), and at a spatial scale across Australia, to a degree not done before.\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe final step in my project involved analysing the massive dataset created by the machine learning models. This dataset contained detailed information about the leaves, including their leaf area, leaf curvature and the size of the largest in-circle. As each herbarium sheet had their collection latitude and longitude I could then map it to climate, and see how the leaf traits changed across various variables. Furthermore, with their indepth taxonomic sampling, for the first time in literature, I explored how the leaf trait varied across the eucalypt taxonomy.\nFor a detailed analysis of the trends and patterns discovered in the dataset, check out my next blog post, where I share my novel findings and pretty graphs."
