But after that, I'm a plant ecologist who love all taxa, okay, except maybe the palms. I've dabbled in trait ecology, machine learning, and now genetics. All in a search to find what my niche is. Come check out what I've been up to in my posts, ranging from social outreach to new bits of code. Want to work with me? Feel free to send me an [email](mailto:karinag.work@gmail.com) or reach out in my socials!</p>\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n<p>\n\nÂ \n\n<p>\n\n\n*University of New South Wales* (2019-2023)\\\nBacherlor's of Advanced Science (Hons.) major in Ecology and minor in Chemistry\n\n-   First Class Honours\n-   2021 Faculty of Science Dean's List\n-   University Medal in Ecology\n-   WAM: 88.625 / GPA: 6.83\n\n*Cheltenham Girl's High School* (2012-2018)\n\n-   ATAR: 98.05\n\n## [**Current Occupation**]{.underline}\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>*Botanic Gardens of Sydney; Research Centre of Ecosystem Resilience (ReCER, BGSyd)* (March 2022 - Current)\\\nTechnical Officer Biodiversity Genomics</summary>\n\n-   Wet lab work on Lenwebbia sp & Gossia frangratissima for successful extraction of high molecular weight DNA full genome sequencing.
